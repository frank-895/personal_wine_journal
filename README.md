***Personal Wine Journal Website***

This repository contains the development of a Personal Wine Journal Website, aimed at wine enthusiasts and businesses to digitally manage their wine consumption and collections. The website allows users to privately track wines they’ve consumed, upload photos, and note tasting details. For businesses, it serves as a wine database, enabling them to manage their cellars and provide tasting notes to staff for customer queries.

**Project Goals**

*Personal Wine Journal:*

Allow users to create an account and maintain a private journal of wines they have consumed or purchased.

Users can:
- Upload photos of wine bottles.
- Document tasting notes (aroma, flavor, finish, etc.).
- Rate wines based on personal preference.

Wine Database for Businesses:
- Provide businesses (e.g., restaurants, wineries) with a wine inventory tool.
- Enable businesses to manage their cellar and record tasting notes for staff to provide accurate information to customers.
- Provide easy access to wine specifications like vintage, region, and varietal.

**Features**

*Wine Entry Management:*
-Upload and store photos of wine bottles.
-Record tasting notes such as aroma, flavor profile, finish, and overall rating.
-Store additional wine details (e.g., vintage, producer, varietal, region).

*Searchable Wine Collection:*
- Users can easily search for specific wines in their collection by name, region, vintage, or tasting notes.

*Private Records:* 
- Unlike other wine apps or websites, all information stored is private and visible only to the user.

*Wine Database for Businesses:*
- Businesses can use the platform to maintain a digital wine cellar.
- Staff can access tasting notes and wine details to assist customers.

**Hypothesis**

We believe there is a strong demand for a digital solution to replace physical wine journals, with a focus on privacy and ease of use. The following hypotheses guide the development of this project:

- High-Risk/High-Value: Users want the ability to upload bottle specifications, a photo, and tasting notes for each wine.
- Moderate-Risk/Moderate-Value: Users want to maintain a personal collection of wines they’ve consumed or purchased and have it accessible across devices.
- Low-Risk/Moderate-Value: Users want a searchable collection, allowing them to find specific wines easily.

**Lessons Learned**

This project was a learning experience in developing websites using key web technologies, including HTML, CSS3, JavaScript, and JSON. Through building the Personal Wine Journal, I gained hands-on experience in:

- HTML: Structuring web pages and understanding the foundation of web development.
- CSS3: Implementing responsive designs and layouts to ensure the website works well on various screen sizes.
- JavaScript: Adding interactivity, including DOM manipulation and handling user input for recording and displaying data.
- JSON: Storing and managing user data such as wine tasting notes and bottle specifications in a structured format.

This project improved my ability to work with the front-end web stack and provided a solid understanding of how to create dynamic, interactive web applications.

**Future Improvements**
- Back-End Integration: Connect the website to a back-end server and database to store user entries and account information.
- Mobile App: Develop a mobile version of the website for easier access on the go.
- Advanced Search Filters: Implement more complex search functionalities like filtering by wine rating, price, or wine type.
- Wine Pairing Suggestions: Add a feature where users receive food pairing suggestions based on the wines they record.
