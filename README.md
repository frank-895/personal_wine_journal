As the wine industry continues to expand year after year, especially new-world wines from lesser known regions, the market for personal wine journals has expanded. 
Wine enthusiasts and businesses are increasingly interested in keeping a record of wines they have consumed and purchased. 
However, this sector is yet to be digitised, as many people still rely on notebooks and physical wine journals, leaving an open market for a digital version of the same product. 

Goals
To create a website that works as a personal wine journal, where people can photograph the wines they have consumed and note the tasting notes and rate the wine. This would be private, instead of shared and public, like many current wine websites. 
Provide a ‘wine database’ for businesses or people with wine collections, so they can track their cellar and have a record for staff of the tasting notes for wines when customers require further information.

Hypothesis
We believe people have a desire to keep personal, private records about wines they have purchased and/or consumed. 
A list of hypotheses for the website listed is listed below in order of highest risk/value to lowest risk/value:
1.	Our customers want to access:
a.	Bottle specifications,
b.	A photo, and,
c.	Personal tasting notes
They have uploaded about a particular wine. 
2.	Our customers want to save a collection of purchased/consumed wines (i.e., have an account)
3.	Our customers want to search for a particular wine in their collection.
