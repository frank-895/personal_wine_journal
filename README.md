# Personal Wine Journal Website üç∑üç∑üç∑

This repository contains the development of a Personal Wine Journal Website, aimed at wine enthusiasts and businesses to digitally manage their wine consumption and collections. The website allows users to privately track wines they‚Äôve consumed, upload photos, and note tasting details. For businesses, it serves as a wine database, enabling them to manage their cellars and provide tasting notes to staff for customer queries.

## Project Goals

**This website is developed in raw HTML, CSS and JavaScript and is intended purely as a learning exercise.** It also acts as a proof of concept, while allowing us to understand the key underlying components of a webpage. In practice, this website requires significantly further improvement, including further backend integration with a database to allow accounts to be created to store the information. However, as you will see later, this project was a **fantastic** opporunity to learn valuable skills and concepts relating to web development ([Lessons Learned](#lessons-learned)).

Users can:
- Upload photos of wine bottles.
- Document tasting notes (aroma, flavor, finish, etc.).
- Rate wines based on personal preference.

Wine Database for Businesses:
- Provide businesses (e.g., restaurants, wineries) with a wine inventory tool.
- Enable businesses to manage their cellar and record tasting notes for staff to provide accurate information to customers.
- Provide easy access to wine specifications like vintage, region, and varietal.

## Features

### Wine Entry Management
- Upload and store photos of wine bottles.
- Record tasting notes such as aroma, flavor profile, finish, and overall rating.
- Store additional wine details (e.g., vintage, producer, varietal, region).

### Searchable Wine Collection
- Users can easily search for specific wines in their collection by name, region, vintage, or tasting notes.

### Private Records
- Unlike other wine apps or websites, all information stored is private and visible only to the user.

### Wine Database for Businesses
- Businesses can use the platform to maintain a digital wine cellar.
- Staff can access tasting notes and wine details to assist customers.

## Hypothesis

We believe there is a strong demand for a digital solution to replace physical wine journals, with a focus on privacy and ease of use. The following hypotheses guide the development of this project:

- High-Risk/High-Value: Users want the ability to upload bottle specifications, a photo, and tasting notes for each wine.
- Moderate-Risk/Moderate-Value: Users want to maintain a personal collection of wines they‚Äôve consumed or purchased and have it accessible across devices.
- Low-Risk/Moderate-Value: Users want a searchable collection, allowing them to find specific wines easily.

## Lessons Learned

This project was a valuable learning experience in developing websites using key web technologies, including HTML, CSS3, JavaScript, and JSON. Through building the Personal Wine Journal, I gained hands-on experience in:

- HTML: Structuring web pages and understanding the foundation of web development.
- CSS3: Implementing responsive designs and layouts to ensure the website works well on various screen sizes.
- JavaScript: Adding interactivity, including DOM manipulation and handling user input for recording and displaying data.
- JSON: Storing and managing user data such as wine tasting notes and bottle specifications in a structured format.

Additionally, I gained insight into collaborating in Agile and Lean development environments. Working within these frameworks helped me:

- Agile: Understand the importance of iterative development, regular feedback, and continuous improvement. I learned how to break down tasks into manageable sprints and actively collaborate with team members to adjust priorities and ensure the project stayed on track.
- Lean: Focus on efficiency by reducing waste and optimizing workflow. This approach encouraged me to refine processes, deliver functional components quickly, and emphasize user value throughout development.
This project not only improved my ability to work with the front-end web stack but also provided a solid understanding of how to create dynamic, interactive web applications while applying Agile and Lean methodologies to deliver high-quality software efficiently

## Future Improvements
- Back-End Integration: Connect the website to a back-end server and database to store user entries and account information.
- Mobile App: Develop a mobile version of the website for easier access on the go.
- Advanced Search Filters: Implement more complex search functionalities like filtering by wine rating, price, or wine type.
- Wine Pairing Suggestions: Add a feature where users receive food pairing suggestions based on the wines they record.
